## Finding info about contributing on the website.

In the following section you should only enter the information that you
found on the project website. Some of the answers will be impossible to find, others
may be very hard to find. Do not _google_ for answers.

__Project website:__ [Website](https://pytorch.org)


__What is the purpose of the project:__
PyTorch는 신경망 구축에 사용되는 소프트웨어 기반 오픈 소스 딥 러닝 프레임워크로, Torch의 머신 러닝(ML) 라이브러리와 Python 기반의 고급 API를 결합한 것이다.
PyTorch는 간단한 선형 회귀 알고리즘부터 복잡한 컨볼루션 신경망과 컴퓨팅 비전 및 자연어 처리(NLP)와 같은 작업에 사용되는 생성형 트랜스포머 모델에 이르기까지 다양한 신경망 아키텍처를 지원한다.
널리 알려진 Python 프로그래밍 언어를 기반으로 구축되고 사전 구성된(심지어 사전 학습된) 모델의 광범위한 라이브러리를 제공하는 PyTorch를 통해 데이터 과학자는 코드와 수학적 구조에 소요되는 시간과 노동력을 최소화하면서 정교한 딥 러닝 네트워크를 구축하고 실행할 수 있다.
